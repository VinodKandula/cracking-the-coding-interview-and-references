    /* Question: What's the difference between a thread and a process? */

    /* A Thread can exist alone or be a part of the process
    * (i.e. An Application which runs multiple tasks simultaneously to achieve the result)
    * Microsoft Word is an application which might contain a thread for monitoring the user's
    * input and showing the characters for viewing.
    * 1) Thread are like a processor if they exist alone and they have to do the entire process themselves
    * 2) Process cannot share the memory between them directly as like threads, which can
    * share easily if the threads are of same process. */
